#pizza-hunt
## Description 
A social media style recipe application for creating and sharing custom pizzas
## User Story  
The client has completed the app's front end, but they've struggled with creating an API layer on the back end because their ever-evolving ideas clash with a rigid database structure.
NoSQL databases, like MongoDB. MongoDB does not require the rigid structure that a SQL table does. Instead, it lets you store data in a format that works more like JSON, which allows more flexibility in app creation.
